Simple Interest Calculator

A Simple Interest Calculator is a basic application that helps users calculate the simple interest and total amount based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, user input handling, and mathematical calculations.

Features

Calculate Simple Interest instantly

Calculate Total Amount (Principal + Interest)

User-friendly interface

Fast and accurate results

Beginner-friendly project

Lightweight and easy to use

Formula Used

The calculator uses the standard simple interest formula:

Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest


Where:

Principal (P) = Initial amount of money

Rate (R) = Interest rate per year (%)

Time (T) = Time period (years)

SI = Simple Interest

Example

Input:

Principal = 1000
Rate = 5%
Time = 2 years


Output:

Simple Interest = 100
Total Amount = 1100
